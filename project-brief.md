# Project Brief

This slide deck is a presentation on my research and creative work in digital sound design at University of North Florida. This was the prompt they gave me: 

Present Your Work: This session will have candidates present their expertise in the field by sharing compositions, performance recordings, recording sessions, or projects they have completed with students, or any other ‘work’ they have created that demonstrates their interest in music technology. We don’t want candidates to give a recital, rather a presentation on their professional work in the field. (1 hr total) (we will be holding this session in the Midi Lab by default, which has computers, interfaces, projector, speakers, laptop connection, etc.; Let me know if you have additional needs)
