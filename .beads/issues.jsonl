{"id":"research-slides-2026-1q5","title":"Add a future directions / vision for UNF slide","description":"For a job talk, the search committee wants to know what you would bring to UNF specifically. The deck currently ends with Bibliography -\u003e Questions. Consider adding a slide before the closing that outlines: future research directions, how your work connects to UNF's programs and facilities (MIDI Lab mentioned in the brief), potential student project opportunities, courses you could teach or develop. This signals forward momentum and fit with the institution.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tatecarson@pm.me","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:44:57.902692-06:00","created_by":"Tate Carsson","updated_at":"2026-02-07T09:36:35.101527-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T09:36:35.101527-06:00","close_reason":"Added Future Directions slide with place-based sound art methodology, Above and Below as example, and student mentorship framing.

{"id":"research-slides-2026-4fd","title":"Expand Drift section with fabrication photos and Orphic Media framing","description":"The current-research/ folder has 4 compelling photos (Tim Murray fabricating, wood components, the hanging sculpture in gallery, CNC routing) that aren't in the deck. The FRI application provides rich theoretical framing around Orphic Media (Hagood) and the noise-to-music continuum. Add 2-3 slides showcasing the physical fabrication process and the installed sculpture, and strengthen the speaker notes with the Orphic Media concept. Reference artists Zimoun, Trimpin, Eliasson as context.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tatecarson@pm.me","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:44:23.572642-06:00","created_by":"Tate Carsson","updated_at":"2026-02-07T09:15:35.532634-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T09:15:35.532634-06:00","close_reason":"Added fabrication slide with routing + components photos, strengthened all Drift speaker notes with Orphic Media framing and artist references"}
{"id":"research-slides-2026-6xk","title":"Highlight student collaboration more prominently","description":"The UNF brief explicitly mentions 'projects they have completed with students.' Currently Carter Gordon's role in Resonant Landscapes is mentioned in one speaker note and one photo caption. The Resonant Landscapes concert slides show student performers but don't name them or describe the pedagogical context. Add explicit framing about mentoring students in research — Carter as undergraduate collaborator on Resonant Landscapes (co-author on Audio Mostly paper), the DSU concert as a student-driven creative outcome, and any MatchLab internship students.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tatecarson@pm.me","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:44:31.000519-06:00","created_by":"Tate Carsson","updated_at":"2026-02-06T16:54:04.545245-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T16:54:04.545245-06:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
{"id":"research-slides-2026-8x4","title":"Replace Research Overview table with a more engaging visual","description":"The Research Overview slide (slide 3) is a plain markdown table listing works and years. For a presentation, a visual timeline or thematic diagram would be more engaging and help the audience see the narrative arc: from performer-controlled notation (And the water receded) -\u003e audience participation (A more perfect union, Mesh Garden) -\u003e locative/outdoor (Sounds Aware, Resonant Landscapes) -\u003e current research (MatchLab, Drift). Consider a horizontal timeline with thematic labels, or at minimum add a brief thematic subtitle to each entry in the table.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tatecarson@pm.me","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:44:51.802701-06:00","created_by":"Tate Carsson","updated_at":"2026-02-07T09:42:53.118257-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T09:42:53.118257-06:00","close_reason":"Tried a visual alternative, didn't work.

{"id":"research-slides-2026-bo4","title":"Consider pacing for 1-hour format","description":"The brief says the session is 1 hour total. The current deck has ~40 slides including video embeds. With Q\u0026A time, that's roughly 35-45 minutes of presentation. The YouTube embed for 'And the water receded' starts at 5:30 — how long will you play it? The Vimeo embeds for 'A more perfect union' and 'immaterial.cloud' also need planned durations. Consider adding time cues in speaker notes (e.g., 'play 1 minute of video') and think about whether the pacing allows enough time for Drift and MatchLab — the current/future work that will excite the committee most.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tatecarson@pm.me","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:45:12.726358-06:00","created_by":"Tate Carsson","updated_at":"2026-02-06T16:45:12.726358-06:00"}
{"id":"research-slides-2026-cmi","title":"Add a technology expertise / technical range slide","description":"The brief asks candidates to demonstrate 'expertise in the field' of music technology. The deck shows individual works but never explicitly frames the breadth of technical skills: Web Audio API, peer-to-peer networking (WebRTC), ambisonics and spatial audio, GPS/gyroscope sensor integration, Arduino/microcontrollers, genetic algorithms, granular synthesis, ML/semantic audio retrieval. A single slide near the beginning (after the smartphone platform slide) or woven into the Research Overview could make the technical depth visible at a glance. This is especially important for a committee that may not be deeply familiar with every technology mentioned.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tatecarson@pm.me","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:44:44.10352-06:00","created_by":"Tate Carsson","updated_at":"2026-02-07T09:23:03.783047-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T09:23:03.783047-06:00","close_reason":"Not needed — individual project slides already demonstrate technical range in context.

{"id":"research-slides-2026-kq8","title":"Strengthen speaker notes for concert and image-only slides","description":"Several slides have minimal or repetitive speaker notes: the Resonant Landscapes concert slides (slides 33-36) all say the same thing ('DSU faculty and students composed works...'). The image-only slides for League of Automatic Music Composers and Karl Sims have notes but could better connect back to your own work. The Sounds Aware UI screenshots (slides 19-20) have thin notes. These are opportunities to add talking points that connect each slide to the broader narrative — especially important for a 1-hour presentation where you'll need substantial speaking material.","status":"in_progress","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tatecarson@pm.me","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:45:04.895456-06:00","created_by":"Tate Carsson","updated_at":"2026-02-07T09:43:05.799883-06:00"}
{"id":"research-slides-2026-s7v","title":"Add visuals or demo for MatchLab","description":"MatchLab is currently just bullet points on two slides — no screenshots, no UI mockup, no demo. For a music technology job talk, showing the semantic sound search tool in action would be much more compelling than describing it. Add at least a screenshot or mockup of the plugin UI, or a short diagram showing the search workflow (text/audio query -\u003e embedding -\u003e results).
